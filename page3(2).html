      <td><h2>When drawing the human body, focus on these key aspects:

1. Proportions: Understand the basic proportions (e.g., the head is typically about 1/8th of the body height).


2. Anatomy: Study muscle groups, bone structure, and how they affect movement.


3. Pose and Gesture: Practice capturing dynamic poses and the overall gesture of the body to convey action.


4. Foreshortening: Learn how to depict objects or limbs that appear shorter due to perspective.


5. Silhouette: Understand the importance of creating a clear and interesting outline.


6. Volume and Form: Use basic shapes (cylinders, spheres) to construct the body and give it depth.


7. Movement and Weight: Study how weight distribution affects posture and balance.


8. Clothing and Fabric: Learn how different fabrics drape and fold on the body.


9. Facial Expressions: Consider how body language and facial expressions work together.


10. Reference: Use live models or photographs for accurate representation.



Regular practice and studying from observation will greatly enhance your skills!
